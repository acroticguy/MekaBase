Diversion Transporter,"Part of Mekanism logistics, the Diversion Transporter is a special transporter that has configurable redstone sensitivity. Since Logistical Transporters do not have a redstone sensitivity option, this is needed when you want to add redstone sensitivity to your logistics system.
You can configure each side of Diversion Transporter separately to the following options by ⇧ Shift + Right Clicking with a Configurator: ""Always active"", ""Active with signal"", and ""Active without signal"".
Note: Redstone sensitivity of all transmitters other than the Logistical Transporter are configurable by themselves, but cannot be done separately for each side.",Diversion Transporter
Control Circuits,"Control Circuits are key components in crafting Mekanism machines/tools. They are present in many recipes, and different recipes may require different tiers of Control Circuits. For example, an Energized Smelter would require Basic Control Circuits, but a Chemical Dissolution Chamber would require Ultimate Control Circuits.",Control Circuits

Locomotive Boosting Unit,"Locomotive Boosting Units are modules that will allow you to boost your sprinting speed and jumping distance. It can be configured from 0.0 sprint boost, to a 0.5 sprint boost. Note that your hunger consumption would also increase.
While sprinting, the modules consumes energy relative to the sprint boost provided. every 0.1 sprint boost will cost 100 FE/t. 
The module applies reduced effects while swimming, and no effects while wading through waist-deep water, as you can not sprint while doing so. A larger speed bonus is gained while swimming on the floor, as the module provides less boost if the player is in the air.

Dimensional Stabilizer,"Dimensional Stabilizers are machines that load their surround chunks, at a hefty energy cost.",Dimensional Stabilizer
Operation,"In the UI, the player can configure the chunkloading behavior of the Dimensional Stabilizer. By clicking on one of the squares, the player can toggle if that chunk is loaded. By interacting with the center square, the player can choose to load all chunks no further than a distance from the dimensional stabilizer, by left clicking to increase the distance and right clicking to decrease it. 
A dimensional Stabilizer can load all chunks no further than 2 chunks away from it in any direction, and nothing further. 
Initially, it has an energy buffer of 16 kFE. This allows you to load 8 chunks at once, as it draws 2kFE/t of power to keep one chunk loaded. This is uniquely not lowered by Energy Upgrades. Energy upgrades only increase the maximum power storage, and therefore the maximum chunks loaded. At least 4 energy upgrades are required to load the full 25 chunks, costing 50 kFE/t.",Dimensional Stabilizer

Obtaining,"Bins require a pickaxe of any type to be mined or the use of a Configurator in wrench mode. Breaking a bin without using a pickaxe will result in the loss of all items that were inside of it.
Crafting
Bins are crafting using five cobblestone, one control circuit of the corresponding tier, one bin of the previous tier (if applicable), and two of either redstone dust or a type of alloy depending on the bin's tier. Any item with the tag ""forge:cobblestone"" can be substituted for vanilla cobblestone in the recipe. Note that blackstone can not be used for crafting bins, as it does not have the aforementioned tag.",Bins
Usage,"Bins have a single storage slot that ignores normal item stacking limits, allowing a large amount of a single type of item to be stored in them. However, bins do not bypass the requirement for every item in the stack to share the same NBT data. As a result, renamed, enchanted, or damaged items can not be stacked in the bin; nor can shulker boxes, backpacks, tanks, or any other portable inventory be stacked, regardless of being vanilla or from a mod. This also includes tools that can be charged with RF or any other fluid, such as the jetpack, flamethrower, or the Configurator.
To insert items, right-click any side of the bin while holding the item in the main hand. Note that the amount currently in the player's hand is the amount that will be inserted. Double right-clicking the bin with the item in hand will deposit all of the items of the same type in the player's inventory into the bin. Left-clicking on the front (the side with the item icon and the amount of items displayed as a number) will extract one stack of items, while shift left-clicking will extract exactly one item.
Shift-right-clicking a bin with any item in it will lock it. A locked bin will not accept another item type until unlocked, even if it was empty.
Portable Inventory
As bins retain their inventory when picked up, they can be used as portable item storage, similar to how shulker boxes act in vanilla. Unlike shulker boxes, bins permit items to be both inserted and extracted without needing to place it down in the world.
To insert items, the bin can be placed into a crafting grid along with the items the player desires to add, and then removing the bin from the output slot, as long as the items to be inserted are the same as what is already in the bin. To extract items, the bin can be placed in a crafting grid with no other items; from there items can be extracted one stack at a time from the output slot.",Bins

Upgrades,"Each MekaSuit armor piece supports a variety of different upgrades which give the user various benefits and abilities. Some of these are unique to a specific armor piece, and cannot be installed on other armor pieces. Upgrades are installed using Modules at the Modification Station. Once installed, upgrades can be removed and, if the upgrade is not unique, can be reinstalled on other armor pieces by uninstalling it at a Modification Station and putting it on another armor piece as normal. Each armor piece could have several modules of the same type installed to it depending on the module type, in some cases up to 8. In this case each additional upgrade will improve the ability/effectiveness of the module upgrade. Each module can be uninstalled individually just like machine Upgrades. Modules can be toggled through their various modes if they have more than 1 using the appropriate corresponding armor mode switch key. They can also be configured in the master menu for all modules.",Mekasuit
Usage,"The MekaSuit like most rechargable Mekanism items has infinite durability, requiring Forge Energy to function instead. Every time the player takes damage it uses up some of the electricity in the armor, evenly distributing the charge loss throughout all pieces at once. Modules that take energy to function instead use it from the specific piece they are installed on. The total charge remaining is shown both when hovering over the suit pieces in the inventory and as a green bar where armor points are usually displayed. Each piece holds 6.40MFE at base. When combined with a Charge Distribution Unit and generator units such as the Geothermal Generator Unit, it is possible for the wearer to never run out of energy in the MekaSuit. If any piece of the MekaSuit runs out of energy, it falls back to provide ordinary armor stats equal to the corresponding netherite piece. When worn, the MekaSuit Helmet brings up an Augmented Reality inspired UI within the player's field of view. It displays the following information to the player:
Top Left: The remaining charge (as a percentage) of each currently worn armor piece.
Bottom Left: The current location coordinates (X,Y,Z) of the player, within a simple compass which shows orientation.
Bottom Right: The current status of modules installed. For example, it will display remaining jetpack hydrogen if the player has the Jetpack Unit installed, or how much food is remaining in the helmet if the Nutritional Injection Unit is installed.",Mekasuit
Damage Reduction,"The damage reduction of the Meka-Suit is configurable with the gear.toml file. By default, a charged Meka-Suit blocks 100% of all damage, but magic damage (like from potions or the wither effect) isn't blocked unless the Inhalation Purification Unit is installed (which provides magic damage immunity at the expense of energy). Also, the Meka-Suit won't block damage from other mods that's registered as armor bypassing (such as Create crushing wheels or Pneumaticraft miniguns). Uniquely, the damage of the Warden's Sonic Boom attack is reduced by 75% only. To reduce damage, 100 kJ (40 kFE) energy is consumed for every point of damage absorbed. With the Inhalation Purification Unit installed, magic damage instead consumes 1 kJ (400 FE) energy per damage point.",Mekasuit
Trivia,"With a full set of fully charged but unupgraded (save for the Charge Distribution Unit) mekasuit, one can block 640 damage before running out of energy. After fully upgrading all suit pieces with energy upgrades, one can block 163840 damage before running out of energy. or 100 times that if the damage is magical in nature. Without the charge distribution unit, the damage absorption is lowered, as some pieces may run out of energy and stop providing total protection. While almost entirely unneeded due to its massive damage absorption capabilities, wearing any pieces of the mekasuit will make piglins neutral to the player. Piglins will also pick up and equip mekasuit pieces over all vanilla armor, even while uncharged. Note that mekasuits on enemies do not use energy to provide protection: they are equivalent to netherite armor.

Statistics Tab
 The Statistics tab of the Controller GUI
The Statistics gives the user various technical information regarding injection rate, max temp, passive generation and steam production.",Fusion Reactor
Starting the Reaction,"The Fusion Reactor will not start on its own. It requires a plasma temperature of 100MK and a filled Hohlraum to begin the fusion process. Once the reaction is jump started, it will begin consuming supplied fuel, heating up the case and generating power.
To achieve a plasma temperature of 100MK, two methods can be used. 

By firing a laser carrying at least 1 GFE of energy at the Laser Focus Matrix, the reactor will be instantly started if a filled Hohlraum is available. To achieve 1 GFE of energy, aim lasers at a Laser Amplifier, which allows you to control the firing with redstone. By setting the redstone setting to NORMAL and putting a button next to it, you can choose to only fire when you see enough energy accumulated.
Alternatively you can gradually heat the reactor to 100.00MK Plasma temperature. This can be done quickest at 10MFE/t usage with a Resistive Heater, but any source of heat will do although it will approximately take 18 GFE of energy in total to ignite the reactor. While this method costs much more energy, it is much faster unless the player uses many lasers.
Putting the resistive heater next to the reactor will not work. To import heat from the resistive heater, it must be next to a Fusion Reactor Port.
If the player is in creative mode, right clicking the laser focus matrix with a configurator will instantly set the reactor energy to 1 GK, enough to start the reaction if a Hohlraum is already placed.",Fusion Reactor
Operations,"While it may be tempting to water cool the fusion reactor, the amount of steam produced quickly spirals out of control. Unless one is willing to build tens of max-size industrial turbines, it is best to keep the reactor running dry.
To keep the reactor running at a constant rate, it is easiest to pipe in Deuterium and Tritium separately at a rate greater than half of the specified injection rate in the fuel tab for each type of fuel. This will create around 20 MFE/t at the highest injection rate (98 mB/t).
For massively increased production, the player should instead pre-mix Deuterium and Tritium into the D-T Fuel, which will skip the entire injection process, and be used for fusion directly. As a result, the injection rate does not limit a D-T Fueled reactor. However, while running on D-T Fuel only, the entire tank is instantly consumed every tick. Given that the tank holds 1000 mB of fuel by default, fusion will stop unless there is a constant supply of D-T Fuel faster than 1000 mB/t. This will require most players to scale up their infrastructure, but creates around 200 MFE/t.",Fusion Reactor
Producing Enough D-T Fuel,"As stated above, producing 1000 mB/t or more D-T Fuel is necessary to maximize the power production of a fusion reactor. This section lists the necessary setup to do so. 

50 Electric Pumps with Filter Upgrade installed
1 Electrolytic Separator
6 Thermal Evaporation Plant, with 5 producing brine and 1 producing lithium
3 Rotary Condensentrator
Several Resistive Heater, ideally 6
55 Electric Pump without filter upgrade installed
A large number of Solar Neutron Activator, see below to calculate how many
2 Chemical Infuser
A large number of Ultimate Pressurized Tubes or a few Dynamic Tank to store lithium and tritium
All machines are fully upgraded with speed and energy upgrades. All brine towers are full size, with 11 electric pumps supplying each with water. The lithium tower must be at full size as well. All towers must have a resistive heater each set to at least 1250 FE/t usage. 
Solar Neutron Activators are the main concerns of this setup. As their production speed can vary wildly with their biome, position, time and weather, it may be a good idea to check the production of one unit in clear sky at noon, place enough units to reach 500 mB/t production in total, then over double that number to account for rainy/thundering days and night time. A large tritium reservoir is mandatory to account for the influence of weather and time. 
If this setup fails at any point to deliver 1000 mB/t of D-T fuel, the reactor will instantly shutdown.",Fusion Reactor
Tips,"It may seem like a good idea to use the same water cycle for both your fission and fusion reactors. However, in interest of safety, it may be better to build a separate industrial turbine for the Fusion Reactor. While there is no problem if both reactors are running, any interruption to the fusion reactor's operation may cause it to drain all water into its massive internal tank, leading to a swift meltdown for the fission reactor.
This is yet another reason to run fusion reactors dry: they simply produce energy from water, and are completely safe no matter what.",Fusion Reactor
Trivia,"The Fusion Reactor is one of the two only multiblocks in Mekanism that deals damage to entities inside while active. In this case, all entities inside of it take 50000 magic damage approximately once per second.
This guarantees a swift death for all but the most durable players, wearing a full set of MekaSuit with the Inhalation Purification Unit.

Dirty Dusts,"Dirty dusts are a product of the ore refining process.
The Crusher turns clumps into dirty dusts. Use the Enrichment Chamber to turn these into useful dusts again.",Dusts
Sulfur Dust,"Sulfur Dust by itself is not used in much recipes. It can be used as a substitution for Yellow Dye, and be used to create gunpowder using an Enrichment Chamber. However, what makes it such an important ingredient is its ability to produce Sulfur Dioxide in a Chemical Oxidizer.
Sulfur Dioxide can then be used to produce Sulfur Trioxide when used in a Chemical Infuser with Oxygen.
Sulfur Trioxide can then be used to produce Sulfuric Acid when used in a Chemical Infuser with Water Vapor. Sulfuric Acid is a key ingredient that is used in the Ore Processing system and in Fissile Fuel Production. A Chemical Dissolution Chamber requires Sulfuric Acid and ores to produce Dirty Slurries (an ingredient in the 5x ore processing process), and requires Sulfuric Acid and Fluorite to produce Hydrofluoric Acid (an ingredient in the production of Fissile Fuel).",Dusts

Salt,"Salt is a material obtained from mining Salt Blocks. Salt can also be obtained by processing Gaseous Brine through the Chemical Crystallizer.
Salt can be used to craft back into its originating block (Salt Block) as well as for producing Gaseous Brine in a Chemical Oxidizer. It can also be used to supply a Chemical Injection Chamber with Hydrogen Chloride.",Dusts
Hydrostatic Repulsor Unit,"""Uses advanced technology to repel water, lowering the resistance felt while moving through it.""The Hydrostatic Repulsor Unit is a Module that when installed in the MekaSuit Pants increases the player's movement speed while they are in water.",Hydrostatic Repulsor Unit
Effect,"While 3 or less of this module is installed, it behaves as if the player is wearing boots that are enchanted with an equivalent level of Depth Strider. 
Installing the fourth one does not increase swim speed further passively. Instead, the swim boost setting is unlocked. When toggled on, the player's speed is approximately doubled while moving in liquid. 
500 Joules of energy is consumed every tick if swim boosting is on and the player is in contact with any liquid. No energy is consumed otherwise. Note that this energy consumption is not observed in creative mode.",Hydrostatic Repulsor Unit
Fission Reactor Logic Adapter,"A  Fission Reactor Logic Adapter is a block used to remotely control a Fission Reactor. With one installed, the user can use various events or conditions to control the reactor automatically with no manual input. This is useful for prevention of meltdowns. It can be accessed by right-clicking it.",Fission Reactor Logic Adapter

Usage,"The Fission Reactor Logic Adapter is installed in the side of the Fission Reactor, replacing either Fission Reactor Casing or Reactor Glass blocks. The location does not matter, as long as it is placed on a wall and not a corner. The red dot can output or receive a redstone signal depending on the configuration.",Fission Reactor Logic Adapter
Configuration,"There are currently 6 configuration options available to set the Logic Adapter to:

disabled - disables reaction to redstone signal, essentially turns the block off
activation - upon receiving a redstone signal the adapter will shut off the reactor
high temperature - when the temperature of the reactor gets critical a redstone signal is emitted
excess waste - when the reactor has excess waste a redstone signal is emitted
damage critical - when damage to the reactor gets to 100% redstone signal is emitted
insufficient fuel - when there is insufficient fuel to maintain a reaction a redstone signal is emitted
These can be activated by clicking the desired setting. The GUI will display the current mode of the Logic Adapter and the current reactor status at the bottom.",Fission Reactor Logic Adapter
Computer Integration Methods,"NOTE: These are not all methods, but they are the most useful ones.
