Doing so will yield 9 Sulfur Dusts and 1,000mb of Hydrogen.\n\nGunpowder Method\nBy using Hydrogen Chloride and Gunpowder in a Chemical Injection Chamber, you can produce Sulfur Dust. You can obtain gunpowder from flint or a vanilla creeper farm.\n\nFlint Method\nPutting Flint into a Crusher will produce gunpowder, which can then be used in the Gunpowder Method.

The optimal minimal build consists of\n\n72 SPS Casings (includes 12 for 3 SPS Ports)\n123 Reactor Glass or Structural Glass\n3 SPS Ports\n1 Supercharged Coil\n\nFor maximal production exchange one Reactor Glass for an additional SPS Port and a Supercharged Coil.\nThe frame of the Supercritical Phase Shifter must consist of SPS Casings. The sides, bottom and top can consist of either SPS Casings, Reactor Glass or SPS Ports. In order to insert energy through a port a Supercharged Coil has to be attached to the SPS Port on the inside of the construct.

As an entangloporter can simutaneously supply items, energy, gas and liquid, only two is needed for a reaction chamber (different fluids do not mix, so there need to be two different networks), as opposed to the usual 6 cables."

Note that the amount currently in the player's hand is the amount that will be inserted. Double right-clicking the bin with the item in hand will deposit all of the items of the same type in the player's inventory into the bin.

This will not result in the loss of the contents of the bin used in the upgrade.\nIt is arguably more resource efficient to upgrade bins through the crafting method rather than by using a tier installer.

How much heat is generated depends on the rate at which it burns Fissile Fuel. The only way to transform this heat into power is to inject \"fresh\" coolant into the reactor and use the heated coolant that comes out to generate power. With water cooled reactors, power is generated by directly piping steam into an Industrial Turbine. Sodium cooled reactors use a Thermoelectric Boiler as a heat-exchanger to cool down the Superheated sodium and heat up water into Steam that is in turn sent to an Industrial Turbine.\nFission reactors need special care: even at very low burn rates, they generate heat faster than they can dissipate it to the environment. The biggest problem most players will face will be to maintain a steady flow of coolant.\nFor more tips and tutorials, see the Fission Reactor Tutorial page.\nNote: You must have Mekanism: Generators installed to have the fission reactor in your game. Without generators, there is no way to obtain polonium using only base Mekanism."

The max water output from a turbine can be seen in its statistics tab. The actual value is 64000 mB of water per condenser. Condensers must be placed above the Rotational Complex.\nthe turbine has an internal energy buffer that will slowly (more or less) fill up. Once full, it will only consume as much steam is needed to provide power to external consumers. As a result, its steam tank will start to fill up if the reactor generates steam faster than the turbine consumes it, less coolant will flow back to the reactor, resulting in less and less fresh coolant in the reactor's coolant tank.

The first two produce Spent Nuclear Waste as a byproduct (at a ratio of 1:10), while Antimatter production is a completely clean process (i.e. no radioactive byproducts).\nNuclear Waste can also be made into reprocessed fuel fragments, which allows for 80% of used fuel to be recovered. Note that looping this process does not yield infinite fuel. However, it is highly efficient, allowing you to burn the same amount of fuel nearly 5 times longer.\nIf a material is radioactive, it will be noted in a specially colored tooltip.\nRadiation can leak into the environment for the following reasons:\nFission reactor overheating leading to a core meltdown (actually blowing up).\nFission reactor running with its waste tank full.\nBreaking any block containing radioactive materials. Most notably Pressurized Tubes and Radioactive Waste Barrels. This also applies to machines, like a Pressurized Reaction Chamber containing polonium for example. These can still be broken safely if they are somehow drained of their radioactive contents beforehand.\nRadioactive materials can be stored in Radioactive Waste Barrels (insert the material from its top or bottom side with a Pressurized Tube. Radioactive Waste Barrels delete their contents at a rate of 1 mB per minute, and are the recommended storage container for waste. Check its page for more information.\nQuantum Entangloporters cannot handle radioactive materials. As a result, it is not possible to make Polonium Pellets with a reactor in the nether (since the Solar Neutron Activator, which is required to produce Polonium from Nuclear Waste needs direct sunlight) or have a reactor in the overworld and store waste in the nether."

This means that at 1200K, the reactor sustains 2% damage per second, and any temperature over 1800K is treated as 1800K (and damages the reactor at 3% per second).\nIf temperature falls under 1200K, the reactor repairs itself at a rate of (1200 - currentTemp) / 120 000 per tick in percentage. This means that the fastest you can repair a reactor is 0.2% per second.\nWhile damage is over 100% and the temperature is above 1200K, the reactor rolls a chance to meltdown every tick. The precise chance is calculated as damage / 1 000 (unit is in percentage) every tick. For example, at 100% damage the meltdown chance per tick would be 0.1%, while at 100 000% damage the chance would be 100%.\nA graph showing the chance to reach a certain damage percentage before meltdown.

There are no consequences for failure, and you can use the following console commands, which are fairly self-explanatory in function:\n /mek build fission\n /mek build remove\n /mek radiation removeAll\nA complete removal of every block constituting a reactor will also remove the associated multiblock data. This is applicable to all multiblocks in Mekanism, but only has notable use for a fission reactor.\nNotably, this allows the player to reset structural damage by mining the entire reactor and replacing it. This can be an unintended and tedious way to save a reactor from melting down.\nAs it counts as a new multiblock, this also voids any nuclear waste stored inside without releasing radiation into the environment. Beware that voiding nuclear waste like this has been confirmed to be a bug, and might be fixed in the future.\nTheoretically, with the best possible luck, a critical reactor (starting from 0% damage and high temperature) can survive at most 9 hours, 15 minutes and 33 seconds. However, practically the reactor will explode much sooner, since the meltdown chance increases with time and is rolled 20 times a second.\nTo reach this point, you must survive 666 666 rolls, each with an increasingly small chance of survival.\nThe chance to reach this theoretical best is so small it is difficult to comprehend: an estimation yields 10^-1 600 000, or 1 in 10...0 with 1.6 million zeroes inbetween.

The Gas-Burning Generator has its own internal storage tank with a capacity of 18,000 units. Gas Tanks can be used to expand the Hydrogen storage capacity of your system. Gas-Burning Generators can generate a maximum of 20,000 J/t (8,000 RF/t). They are an upper tier Mekanism power source that should supply adequate power to your base for a long time, but they are best used when they provide power to charge a bank of Energy Cubes, rather than sending the generator power out directly to your base.\nAs of 1.7.10, 1.12.2, and 1.16.5, 1 mB of Hydrogen gas is converted to 200 J (80 RF). 1 mB of Ethylene is converted to 28200 J (11280 RF). This means that hydrogen should not be used for power generation, as it produces less than it costs. Use Ethylene, or perhaps another compatible fuel from other mods.\nA new feature in Mekanism v9 is that the Gas-Burning Generator will automatically scale its burning rate according to the amount of power stored in its internal buffer (this is usually determined by the tier of Universal Cable it is attached to). The burning rate will increase until the generator is producing the maximum output of 20,000 J/t (8,000 RF/t). This is 100 mB/t for Hydrogen and 0.7 mB/t for Ethylene. The rate is displayed on the right side of the GUI, below the gas and power storage indicators.\nIn Mekanism v10 for 1.16.5, the maximum gas burning and power generation rate is increased. Hydrogen is burned at a maximum rate of 256 mB/t, generating up to 20,480 RF/t, and Ethylene is burned at a maximum rate of 6.4 mB/t, generating up to 72,192 RF/t."

Make a copy and name it something like \"Mekanism-PREVIOUS.cfg\" or something obvious.\n(2) In-Game Preparation:\nSince so many \"mid-process\" ores are affected, clear your ore processing systems. Stop the ore inputs and let your processing lines finish.\nRemove all in-world (placed) Logistical Transporters and Pressurized Tubes. Pipes and Tubes in your inventory will get converted to Basic-level items in the new tiered system. But any Pipes or Tubes that are in-world will get removed! To help you remember what gets connected where, use signs or replace the Pipes and Tubes with another block, like maybe two different colors of wool.\nTake stock of your Free Runners and the ores mentioned above. These items will NOT convert, no matter how you prepare. But don't panic! You will creative-mode them back to yourself after the migration. To be safe, you might want to just dispose of them now, rather than risk a corrupted world later.\n(3) Mekanism update:\nDownload the latest version of the Mekanism mods. Do not download the MDK -- that is for mod developers.\nPlace the new Mek mods in your mods folder\nDisable the previous versions of the Mekansim mods by changing the .jar file to a .jarX file.\nStart Minecraft so that a new config file is generated, then quit. DO NOT ENTER YOUR SERVER WORLD.\n(4) Update the new Mekanism.cfg:\nIf you had made changes to your old Mekanism configuration (power usage, power standard, etc) now is the time to replace your customizations.\nEven if you didn't make any changes, now is a good time to check out what's in there! Mekanism 8 is highly customizable.\n(5) Client-side test world\nUsing your updated configuration, start up a new creative-mode test world LOCALLY.\nDon't start up your server world just yet. Check for \"SEVERE\" or \"ERROR\" errors in the Forge Log. Some errors are OK but you should not see java errors or missing classes.\nIf there were errors, fix and restart the world until everything loads clean.\nOnce you have successfully loaded a new test world, confirm that the new content is in-game. If not, check which version of Mekanism you are using\nA note about APIs. An API is what allows different mods to talk to each other and use each other's stuff. There were several changes in the Mekanism8 API. Other mods might still be looking for the \"old style\" Mekanism API, and when they don't find it, they will likely crash. This is not a Mekanism problem. The author of the mod needs to update to the new Mekanism API, then everything will start working again.\n\n (6) Server-side world\nNow that the client-side testing is done, disable the server's old Mekanism and config files by renaming them.\nCopy your new Mekanism .jar files and your new configuration from your client/local PC to your server.\nStart up your server.\nCheck for \"SEVERE\" or \"ERROR\" errors in the Forge Log.\nRepair & restart as necessary.\nIf everything checks out, then join the server!\n (7) Post-update\nUsing your list of items you knew you'd lose, replace your lost ores and Free Runners, as needed.\nReplace your Logistical Transporters and Pressurized Tubes.\nCheck the connections to Mekanism machines.\nReplace any fluids that you temporarily moved.\nWARNING: If you see any magenta & black boxes, these are items that did not convert. Dispose of these IMMEDIATELY in lava or some other method that takes them out of the world."

After fully upgrading all suit pieces with energy upgrades, one can block 163840 damage before running out of energy.\nor 100 times that if the damage is magical in nature.\nWithout the charge distribution unit, the damage absorption is lowered, as some pieces may run out of energy and stop providing total protection.\nWhile almost entirely unneeded due to its massive damage absorption capabilities, wearing any pieces of the mekasuit will make piglins neutral to the player.\nPiglins will also pick up and equip mekasuit pieces over all vanilla armor, even while uncharged. Note that mekasuits on enemies do not use energy to provide protection: they are equivalent to netherite armor. Mekasuit helmet will provide permanent sun protection to mobs which burn in sunlight."

To achieve 1 GFE of energy, aim lasers at a Laser Amplifier, which allows you to control the firing with redstone. By setting the redstone setting to NORMAL and putting a button next to it, you can choose to only fire when you see enough energy accumulated.\nAlternatively you can gradually heat the reactor to 100.00MK Plasma temperature. This can be done quickest at 10MFE/t usage with a Resistive Heater, but any source of heat will do although it will approximately take 18 GFE of energy in total to ignite the reactor. While this method costs much more energy, it is much faster unless the player uses many lasers.\nPutting the resistive heater next to the reactor will not work. To import heat from the resistive heater, it must be next to a Fusion Reactor Port.\nIf the player is in creative mode, right clicking the laser focus matrix with a configurator will instantly set the reactor energy to 1 GK, enough to start the reaction if a Hohlraum is already placed."

Unless one is willing to build tens of max-size industrial turbines, it is best to keep the reactor running dry.\nTo keep the reactor running at a constant rate, it is easiest to pipe in Deuterium and Tritium separately at a rate greater than half of the specified injection rate in the fuel tab for each type of fuel. This will create around 20 MFE/t at the highest injection rate (98 mB/t).\nFor massively increased production, the player should instead pre-mix Deuterium and Tritium into the D-T Fuel, which will skip the entire injection process, and be used for fusion directly. As a result, the injection rate does not limit a D-T Fueled reactor. However, while running on D-T Fuel only, the entire tank is instantly consumed every tick. Given that the tank holds 1000 mB of fuel by default, fusion will stop unless there is a constant supply of D-T Fuel faster than 1000 mB/t. This will require most players to scale up their infrastructure, but creates around 200 MFE/t."

As their production speed can vary wildly with their biome, position, time and weather, it may be a good idea to check the production of one unit in clear sky at noon, place enough units to reach 500 mB/t production in total, then over double that number to account for rainy/thundering days and night time.

If the Metallurgic Infuser is receiving adequate power, it will begin \"infusing\" the Iron with Carbon, which results in Enriched Iron.\nWith Carbon still in the Secondary Material Buffer, place the Enriched Iron in the Primary Material Slot. This will create  Steel Dust.\nSmelt the Steel Dusts into Steel Ingots.\nNow you can begin expanding your power network so that you can power multiple machines at once. Craft a few  Basic Universal Cables (made from 2 Steel Ingots and a piece of Redstone) and create a line of them trailing from your Heat Generator.\nYour power network is now ready to accommodate many early-tier machines. If you find that your power needs become more demanding, you can try connecting a few more Heat Generators, some Solar Generators (or its much more expensive and efficient version, the Advanced Solar Generator), Wind Turbines (make sure that they are placed at high altitudes for maximum power), or other various generators that Mekanism has to offer. Remember that Mekanism machines can accept most forms of power from other mods (such as RF or MJ) as well as its own (Joules), so feel free to add other sources of power to your Mekanism power network.\nNote that most generators in mekanism are smart, and will only generate power as fast as the demand. If you wish to stockpile energy or keep all your generators running at full capacity, craft Energy Cubes. They store power, and will accept it as fast as their transfer rate allows."

Higher tier factories gain more slots, allowing the machine to process stuff much faster.\nMove on to tier 2 processing (tripling resource output) by adding the Purification Chamber and Electrolytic Separator.\nAlso, you now have the option to create some additional tools and armor that are obsidian and glowstone-based by using the Osmium Compressor.\nNow, you can decide to either move on to further ore processing tiers (such as quadrupling and pentapuling ore yields) or play with the toys and gadgets that Mekanism has to offer, such as the Digital Miner (a configurable, complex machine which can mine blocks around itself) or the Atomic Disassembler (Mekanism's all-in-one mining tool, like the Paxel but instead of durability uses energy, and can mine much faster)."

                "title": "Water based cooling",
                "text": "Water based cooling is sufficient for small setups. The actual limit is for reactors with about 75 Fission Fuel Assembly. It might be possible to go higher since larger reactors run cooler than smaller ones, but the temperature of such a reactor will be above 850K, well into the warning zone. Water cooling is ideal for players who want to start with a small-ish setup to get their feet wet with nuclear fission, or those who just don't want to bother with sodium based cooling.\nA water cooled reactor has a heating rate of 20,000 mB of water for 1 mB of Fissile Fuel burnt. For your reactor to run smoothly, the turbine's max steam flow and max water output must be greater than the reactor's heating rate. The maximum steam flow can be seen on a turbine's main GUI, and the maximum water flow in the stats tab of the GUI. The Industrial Turbine's wiki page gives precise instructions on how to calculate a turbine's maximum flow based on its size and number of vents.\nThe math is pretty tedious, so just keep the following in mind:\n\nThe actual power generated per mB of Fissile Fuel depends on the number of rotor blades in the turbine. Nothing else. The actual value is 7.14 kJ per blade for 1 mB of fissile fuel. For best results, do not hesitate to build a huge turbine and power it with a tiny reactor.\nThe width of the base of the turbine only limits its rotor height (rotor height = (width * 2) - 5), not the total structure height (the Industrial Turbine's wiki page implies otherwise).\nThe limiting factor for the fissile fuel burn rate will be the minimum value between the turbine's steam flow rate (which depends on turbine size and number of turbine vents) and water flow rate (which depends on the number of condensers fitted). If need be, additional layers of condensers can be added on top of the Electromagnetic Coils layer.\nBased on this, the best bang for the buck for a water cooled reactor will be a 5x9x5 turbine with a 5 blocks high rotor (10 blades), 3 coils, the rest of the coil layer fitted with 6 condensers, and a total of 33 vents. While this turbine has a max steam flow of 1,056,000 mB/t, the limiting factor here is the water flow rate: 6 condensers * 64,000 mB/t = 384,000 mB/t. The reactor's maximum burn rate will then be 384,000 / 20,000 = 19.2 mB/t which is roughly the upper limit of water cooling (running at 610 Kelvin, hot, but workable). This will generate a respectable 1.37 MJ/t of power. Also, vents may be expensive at this point for most players: 12 are enough for this setup (this will make the max steam flow rate equal to 384,000 mB/t, matching the water flow rate nicely).\nPump water into a Fission Reactor Port configured as input only\nConnect a Fission Reactor Port configured as coolant output to the steam input valve of an Industrial Turbine.\nConnect a Mechanical Pipe from one of the Industrial Turbine's vents back to the coolant input of the reactor (or back to the same same mechanical pipe network from the first step).\nConnect a Fission Reactor Port configured as waste output to the top or bottom side of Nuclear Waste Barrel with a Pressurized Tube\nThe pipes and tubes connecting the reactor and turbine must have a Throughput at least equal to the heating rate of the reactor. See also #Safe operation. As mentioned above, the power drain must be higher than what the turbine actually produces (use an Induction Matrix between the turbine and the rest of the power consumers. Monitor the matrix's fill ratio regularly. To Reach a Fission reactor running at the max burnrate (1435mB) it is recommended to connect the reactor, boiler and turbine port to port to avoid \nissues with the Throughput.\nThe picture above shows a minimal water cooled fission reactor setup. From left to right: Induction Matrix, Industrial Turbine, Fission Reactor.\nThe reactor has a single Fission Fuel Assembly.\nIt takes Fissile Fuel from its front input port, Nuclear Waste is output to the right to a Radioactive Waste Barrel. In the back behind the reactor.\nthere are two Electric Pumps feeding the coolant loop with fresh water.\nThe Industrial Turbine is the 5x9x5 described above. This setup generates 71.4 kJ/t when burning Fissile Fuel at its maximum of 1 mB/t. That's roughly 2.5 times less power than a Gas-Burning Generator burning Ethylene."

                "title": "Sodium based cooling",
                "text": "Sodium cooled fission reactor\nBoiler - Turbine piping\nWhen things get too hot for your taste, Sodium is a much more efficient coolant and allows very high burn rates at lower core temperatures (but not more energy per mB of fuel burnt). Sodium based cooling requires a Thermoelectric Boiler as an intermediate heat-exchanger to cool down the Superheated sodium from the reactor and heat up water into Steam.\nThe Thermoelectric Boiler has been updated in Mekanism v10 to allow it to use heated coolant as a heat source. The boiler's water and steam tanks double as superheated coolant and coolant tanks. The Boiler Valves can be configured with a Configurator (crouch + right click) to make them input only, output steam or output coolant.\nWith sodium cooling, the reactor will heat 200,000 of sodium per tick per mB of fissile fuel burnt. However, on the turbine's side, the steam and water flow rate requirements will be the same as in the water cooling scenario: 20,000 mB of steam/water per mB of Fissile Fuel. When sizing the turbine, just keep this in mind and use either 20,000*reactor_burn_rate or reactor_heating_rate/10.\nThe size of the boiler will depend on the desired tank sizes and boil rate.\nBoilers have four tanks: heated coolant, water, steam and (cold) coolant. Compared to a Mekanism v9 boiler, in v10 the water tank doubles as a heated coolant tank and the steam tank doubles as a coolant tank. The water tank capacities are:\n\nWater tank: external volume of the boiler from its base (included) to the topmost cavity layer, minus the number of Superheating Elements, multiplied by 16,000 mB.\nHeated coolant tank: 16 times the size of the water tank\nSteam tank: external volume of the boiler from the steam catch layer up to the topmost steam cavity layer multiplied by 160,000 mB. The volume includes the Pressure Dispersers, but not the topmost layer of the boiler casing.\nCoolant tank: volume of the steam tank times 1.6\nA boiler's maximum boil rate (its boil capacity) is determined by the number of installed Superheating Elements. Each element contributes 320,000 mB/t to the boiler's boil capacity. The heating layer does not have to be full of superheating elements, you can install just as many as needed such that the boiler's boil capacity greater or equal than the turbine's max steam and water flow. This will leave that much more room for the water and heated coolant.\nEvaluating the boiler size is more complex. Also, to answer the question how big can make it here and now: a maximum size reactor (18x18x18) needs two boilers to run at above 800 mB/t burn rate and three steam turbines. It reaches its maximum at about 1400 mB/t where it reaches the maximum operating temperature of 1200 K.\nFor example with a 5x18x5 reactor (75 fuel assemblies), the boiler's heated coolant tank size must be about twice the size of the reactor's coolant tank (5*18*5 * 100,000 = 45,000,000 mB). With as much coolant buffered in the coolant return tube and as much water as the water tank's capacity buffered in the water return tubes, the reactor can be started at its maximum capacity without issues. This is a good starting point for small to mid size reactors. Again, start with low burn rates, wait the temperature and all tank levels to stabilize and increase the burn rate gradually.\nSetup a Thermoelectric Boiler + Industrial Turbine as described on the boiler page with the exception that in step 7, you will need two Boiler valves on a steam catch or steam cavity layer, one for steam output, the other for coolant output.\nIt is important to build the boiler with water cavity layers (step 3c of the boiler's setup) in order to have a decent enough water + heated coolant storage capacity. The steam cavity layer is not really necessary here unless you have excess coolant in the system.\nNext, connect the the boiler steam output (at or above the steam catch layer) to the turbine steam input, and pipe water back from one of the turbine's vents to one of the boiler's inputs at the heater or water cavity layers.\nSetup some fully upgraded Electric Pumps (1 KJ/t for 1000 mB of water per tick) to inject fresh water into the water-steam loop. It is necessary to keep them running in order to keep the boiler's water tank full when running at high heating rates. How many pumps are required is left to the reader to experiment with (see #Safe operation).\nFor the reactor itself:\n\nConnect the reactor's heated coolant output to one of the boiler's inputs at the heater or water cavity layers\nConnect the boiler's coolant output to one of the reactor's inputs. While the boiler's valves must be placed in the proper layers. the placement of the reactor ports does not matter.\nConnect a Fission Reactor Port configured as waste output to the top or bottom side of Nuclear Waste Barrel with a Pressurized Tube\nFor your reactor to run smoothly, the tubes connecting the reactor and boiler must have a Throughput greater than the heating rate of the reactor, and the tubes and pipes running between the boiler and turbine must be grater than the boiler's boil capacity (this can be seen in the boiler's stats tab).\nThe picture to the right shows a 5x9x5 sodium cooled fission reactor, backed by a fairly small 5x7x5 Thermoelectric Boiler and a 7x13x7 turbine with 18 blades. It produces 3.85 MJ/t (1.54 MFE/t, 385.63 kEU/t) at peak burn rate (30 mB/t). Note that this same turbine could work with a reactor twice that size, but the boiler would need to be extended. On the right side of the reactor there is a crude, yet effective breaker-switch system (see #Safe operation).\nThe second picture shows the boiler and turbine piping as well as a single pump (which is not enough for this configuration)."

                "text": "The worst thing that can happen is a core meltdown, which results in explosions that occur all over the interior, and sometimes exterior of the reactor. Followed by lethal radiations over a 5 chunks radius (that's 80 blocks) that will last for several in-game weeks.\nA few rules of thumb:\n\nIn order to avoid chunk loading related glitches, do not build a fission reactor, Thermoelectric Boiler or Industrial Turbine on a chunk boundary. If the fission reactor is partly loaded, it will continue to operate, potentially without a stable water cycle to keep it cooled.\nKeep all chunks involved in fission power generation and waste recycling loaded (use an Anchor Upgrade in Teleporters or Quantum Entangloporters).\nFor good measure, even if a tube or pipe just crosses a chunk, keep it loaded.\nAlways start with low burn rates (the default 0.1 mB/t is good!) and increase it in small steps. Even with a positive water cycle, increases in burn rate will rapidly drain water before the cycle can catch up.\nUse conservative on burn rates. Even the biggest reactor backed by several boilers and turbines cannot be started full blast and even less at its maximum theoretical burn rate.\nRead the Throughput page and double check that throughput of the cables, pipes and tubes connecting the different components of your system is sufficient compared to the heating, boiling and flow rates.\nThe water flow rate of the turbine is easy to overlook. It can be checked in the turbine's stats tab and must be greater than the reactor's heating rate for water cooling and 1/10th of it for sodium cooling.\nEvery reactor should have a circuit breaker that will, in many cases, prevent accidental meltdown. This can be done with redstone circuits like RS-latches or edge-detectors.\nThe picture to the right show a simple yet effective circuit breaker based on an edge detector.\nThe bottom Fission Reactor Logic Adapter is set to emit a redstone signal on high temperature. The top one is set to \"activation\". This will activate the reactor when it receives a redstone signal, and deactivate it whenever the signal switches off.\nThe piston is a regular piston with a sand or gravel block on top. The observer is facing towards the camera, sending its signal to the reactor adapter. The only issue when building this breaker it to place the observer correctly (and triple check that the adapter it will cover is set to \"activation\"!). The safest solution is to push it into place using a piston.\nWhenever the bottom adapter will send a redstone signal, this will push the piston and gravel block, making the observer send a one redstone tick pulse to the reactor, activating it (and making it register that it is redstone activated) and deactivating it almost immediately. The redstone torch is not part of the circuit breaker itself (see below).\nDISCLAIMER: A circuit breaker alone will not help in all situations. In case of reactor overheating with a large reactor and burn rate and critical coolant shortage, the temperature will have reached over 1400K before tripping the breaker. Without a quick injection of new coolant, the reactor will not cool down quickly enough and will keep taking structural damage until the unthinkable happens.\nThis is the purpose of the redstone torch and redstone-activated coolant tube on the right-hand side. The tube comes from a dynamic tank used as emergency coolant storage. As long as the high temperature signal is on, the tube will inject fresh coolant from the emergency tank into the reactor, bringing its temperature down much faster.\nJust like for real circuit breakers a test button can be installed just beneath the observer on the face of the reactor. Pushing it should trigger the piston and activate the reactor very briefly before deactivating it.\nAn alarm can also be installed by using the bottom block (the one supporting the redstone dust and torch) as the input of an RS-latch and wiring the alarm on the output of the latch.\nNote that this should not be used to switch off the reactor if the waste tank gets full. This is just not fast enough. A redstone comparator on a waste barrel used as buffer on the reactor's waste output is a much better solution for this purpose.\nIf you're producing more energy than you're utilizing, you'd be required to tune the burn rate as to never fill the internal battery of the Turbine. This can become very time consuming since you have to be constantly checking your burn rate to make sure you're never overproducing, tuning the burn rate so you're never dependent on the water coming from the Turbine, or to toggle the reactor on and off to empty the Turbine battery. If you do not do this, the Turbine will start accumulating steam, since it can no longer convert it into energy because there's nowhere to store it. If the steam storage of the Turbine gets full, it will no longer be able to repurpose the steam as water, and if your reactor depends on this to remain cool, either directly or indirectly, it will dry out fairly quickly, potentially causing a meltdown.\nAn easy workaround for this is to set up an Induction Matrix (a big battery) in-between your Turbine and the rest of your power network, and using redstone circuitry to store the state of the matrix (full, half full, empty, depends on your needs).\nEssentially, what you need to do is set up an RS latch connecting a port from your Matrix using a comparator (arrow pointing away from the port), and the Reactor Logic Adaptor set to Activate the Reactor. The idea is, when the Matrix is full, it Sets the latch, turning the reactor off, and from here on out, all the energy that will be used comes from the battery until it's depleted. Then, once empty, it Resets the latch, turning the reactor back on, refilling the Matrix. The Matrix is still able to be drained while the latch is reset, so if it ever comes to pass that you're consuming more energy than the Reactor is producing, the circuit will never turn off.\nTo get the signal from an empty matrix, simply use the same comparator signal (or a different comparator from a different port on the same Matrix) and invert it, that way, when it has no charge, it can reset the latch.\nThere's a couple things to keep in mind with this set up:\n\nYou need to have ample storage of nuclear waste/spent nuclear waste, and a constant supply of Fissile Fuel, since this method allows you to set high burn rates and the reactor will remain on for long periods of time, maybe even indefinitely.\nMake sure the Induction Provider of the Matrix has a higher input/output than the energy generated from the Turbine. If your Turbine generates more energy per tick than the Matrix can store per tick, it will accumulate on the Turbine, which is the exact scenario we're trying to avoid.\nIt's always a good idea to practice your redstone circuitry in a safe environment, away from your Reactor complex, just to be sure you understand how the latch works and what inputs and outputs you can expect from it. You can simulate a full Matrix with a redstone torch, and an empty one by the absence of a redstone torch.\nIf you already set up the circuit breaker that is explained earlier on this article, you need to use another Reactor Logic Adaptor set to Activate.\nIf you're wondering how to get the Turbine to turn excess steam back into water, you need to add a layer of Saturating Condensers inside of your Turbine, then pipe it out by connecting a Mechanical Pipe to a vent (not a valve)\nBottlenecks in the cooling chain and power drain are what limits the actual burn rate of a reactor.\nThe reactor must have sufficient coolant before starting it and its heated coolant tank must be empty (a non empty tank means that you have excess coolant in the system). Players who will go straight for a sodium based solution may not have yet enough sodium to fully fill the coolant tank. Even at 10% full, the reactor can still be used, just keep the burn rate low enough to always have some fresh coolant in the reactor while it is running.\nMake sure that the Throughput of the pipe or tube networks for the coolant is greater than the heating rate.\nAgain, start with low burn rates (< 1 mB/tick) and wait for the reactor heat to stabilize. If the heat indicator turns yellow (> 600K), the reactor is running too hot (experts can push it well into the \"orange zone\" at 1 to 1.2K but... here be dragons). When it turns orange or red, it's time to hit the SCRAM button (and check that your circuit breaker is working). The same applies if coolant tank fills suddenly and the temperature goes up rapidly. SCRAM! Also check that the heated coolant and water levels in the boiler are stable as well as the steam level in the turbine.\nWhen activating a reactor, some of its coolant immediately moves to the boiler as heated coolant, and some of the boiler's water moves to the turbine as steam. Having enough coolant buffered in the coolant tubes will compensate for this. As for water, you should always have several pumps ton compensate quickly. How quickly depends on how fast it drops when starting the reactor. If looking at the GUI of the boiler, the water level drops below that of the heated coolant, this is a sign that you have not enough water supply and that your boiler tank might not be large enough.\nAgain, an Industrial Turbine must be fitted with enough Saturating Condensers to allow a sufficient flow of water back from the turbine to the reactor or Thermoelectric Boiler. 1 mB/t of Fissile Fuel burnt requires 20000 mB/t of steam and water (this applies to water and sodium cooled reactors). Given that a condenser provides 64000 mB/t of water, this translates to 1 condenser for 3.2 mB/t of Fissile Fuel burnt.\nThe turbine also has an internal power storage (the gauge to the right of its GUI). When this fills up, this is a sign that there is not enough power drain in the system. If you let it reach its maximum, the turbine will stop consuming steam and sending water back into the cooling loop, resulting in a catastrophic meltdown. A solution around this is to:\n\ninstall an induction matrix between your turbine and the rest of your base. A small matrix will do: build a 4x3x4 casing (the faces can be structural glass), install a basic provider and cell, this will give you room for two more cell and let you upgrade your cells as you get the resources to do so. The matrix GUI will give you a good view of how much power is produced and consumed at a glance.\nTune the reactor burn rate to be slightly above your average power usage.\nCheck the matrix from time to time. If it gets full, pop in another cell or upgrade the ones already in it. Or just deactivate the reactor and let the matrix drain.\nA more expensive and extreme alternative is to enable the \"dump excess\" option in the turbine GUI. Like it says on the tin, this will just dump any excess steam. Doing this is dangerous unless you pump enough water into the cooling loop to compensate for the loss. For this you would need 20 (twenty) fully upgraded Electric Pumps per 1 mB/t of fissile fuel burnt."

                "text": "And So It Begins...\nFirst, you're looking to mine some Osmium Ore. Throw it in the Furnace and get out an Osmium Ingot. Take these, four iron ingots, two redstone dusts and two furnaces and craft the Metallurgic Infuser.\nThis is where things really get moving. The Metallurgic Infuser is the root of all Mekanism technology. But there's a problem: we need power in order to make the infuser run. Solution? The Heat Generator. It has two modes: you can pump fuels into it (solid or liquid), or you can set it next to lava. The differences between these two options is described on that previously linked page.\nThere are three basic things you're wanting to make with the metallurgic infuser, but first we're going to make some Steel Ingots. You make these by putting coal, charcoal or Compressed Carbon (more on that later) into the infuser and infusing it into iron ingots. This creates Enriched Iron. Take that Enriched Iron and run it through the Infuser again with more coal-like fuel. This will create Steel Dust, which you can run through the furnace to get the Steel Ingots we need. Make at least a couple dozen for now.\nWith Steel now under our belt, we need to craft some Steel Casings. These are the basic framework of the machines in Mekanism. To craft these, you need four Steel Ingots and one Osmium Ingot, arrayed in a cross with the Osmium in the center. Next we need some Basic Control Circuits. These will be used very often in the first tier of machinery, so make a bunch of them. For the moment, we just need two. Make them by Infusing Osmium Ingots with redstone.\nThe next thing to make is some Enriched Alloy. In fact, we need to make a bunch of them, because we're going to use them all over the place, too. For now, make about a dozen. You can make the Enriched Alloy by putting redstone and iron ingots in the Infuser. You need one of each to make one alloy. After that, grab two of them, four redstone dusts and three gold ingots and craft an Energy Tablet. Make two of them. \nNext, take two of the Steel Ingots and a redstone dust and put them in a line to make Basic Universal Cables. You can run power remotely now! Huzzah! You can also start arranging your machines along the Cables from the Generator, but for now, make another Steel Casing and those two Tablets and use them to make a Basic Energy Cube. Place this on the power-output side of the Heat Generator. Then, start running your Cables from there to the machines, wherever they are. The side of the Energy Cube that has the plate across it, which is by default the side facing you when you place it, is the output side. Every other side is an input.\nPhew! That's a lot of work just to get things started, and we're not even a third of the way through Tier 1.\n\nPower Up\nNow it's time to make a Solar Generator. The heat generator is a very simple start, and we need to start getting some more reliable power in our systems. We can also start talking about power usage. The Basic Cube has a max capacity of 2000 kJ. Interesting tidbit: one stack of coal in the Heat Generator makes 383.52 kJ, and it takes 10 kJ to run the Infuser once.\nSo, the first step in making a Solar Generator is to make three Solar Panels. To make one, you need three glass panes, two redstone dusts, one Enriched Alloy and three Osmium Ingots. Take those three Panels and put them right back in the crafting grid, along with two more Enriched Alloys, an Energy Tablet, an iron ingot, and two Osmium Dusts.\nBut wait! Osmium Dust, you say? How do I get that? Well that requires two more machines we haven't made yet, the Crusher or the Enrichment Chamber. The Crusher can make dusts out of ingots, but the Enrichment Chamber is what we really want, because it doubles our ingot output! Yep, it's the macerator/pulverizer of the Mekanism world. Luckily, we can make all the parts for both. Their recipes are very similar, as well. Throw a Crusher together by combining two Basic Circuits, two lava buckets and four redstone dusts surrounding a Steel Casing, then throw an Osmium Ingot or Ore into it to get some dust. To make the Enrichment Chamber, combine the same components in the same order, just replace the buckets with iron ingots. Throw an ingot into the Crusher, or an Ore into the Enrichment Chamber, and get you some Osmium Dusts.\nOK, back to the Solar Generator. Take those two Dusts and make your first Solar Generator. Guess what? One Solar Generator puts out 60 J/t. The Heat Generator puts out about 100. Take three Solar Generators and you have replaced your Heat Generator! So now you have a renewable source of power that isn't all that expensive, and two of them more than replace the fuel burner! Huzzah! You'll need one Solar Generator for each machine you have running to break even on power, during the day. At night, well... That's why we have the Energy Cube! See, it's already taken care of. You're welcome.\n\nIt's Not Enough!\nWant more power? Well, there are other steps we can take, as well. First, there's the Wind Turbine. You can make this by combining three Osmium Ingots, an Enriched Alloy, a Basic Circuit and two Energy Tablets. At base height 0, the Turbine produces 60 J/t, but its output increases as its elevation does, to an upper limit of 480 j/t. Got mountains? Then you've got a viable replacement for up to two active Heat Generators. The Turbine has only one viable output side: its front. Keep that in mind as you design your power transfer systems.\nThe second option is to upgrade your Solar Generator into an Advanced Solar Generator. You need four Solar Generators, two Enriched Alloys and three iron ingots. The Advanced version of the Solar Gens is better than the sum of its parts. Whereas one Solar Generator outputs 50 J/t (making four of them a total of 200 J/t), the advanced Solar Generator generates 300 J/t. There is a downside, though. The Advanced Solar Generator takes up a 3x3 block space, which means that you could also have a 3x3 array of regular Solar Generators giving you 450 J/t for the same space usage. The Advanced looks cool, and it does have the advantage of being able to output more at once, but it's just not worth it in the long run.\nHmm, 450 J/t... That brings us to the next problem: the Basic Universal Cable is only capable of transferring 500 J/t. That just won't do, if we're to have the power that we need. Solution? Upgrade to Advanced Universal Cables! These are really simple to make, you just have to wrap eight Basic Cables around an Enriched Alloy to get 8 Advanced Cables. These babies can handle up to 2,000 J/t, or 2 kJ! More than enough to handle the power requirements we have so far.\nSide note: the Solar and Advanced Solar Generators get a 50% bonus on their output in desert biomes, so that would give the Solar Generator 75 J/t and the Advanced 450 J/t. If you had an array of nine Solar Generators that would give you 675 J/t output. Yeah, definitely need the Advanced Cables.\nThat reminds me, you'll probably want to upgrade the Basic Energy Cube, as well. It's actually capable of outputting 800 J/t, which should technically be more than enough for the build we have so far, but we want to upgrade the storage capacity too. Take the one you have (if you have one of the myriad mods that supply a wrench, you can shift-right-click the Energy Cubes to \"break\" it while saving the energy stored inside of it), and combine it with four Enriched Alloys, two Osmium Ingots and two Energy Tablets. The new Advanced Energy Cube's capabilities are four times that of the Basic, giving it 8,000 kJ storage capacity and 3.2 kJ/t output. Huzzah!\n\nUpgrading the Basics\nNow that we've gotten the power question answered, let's talk about pulling all of our processing needs into the energy side of things. First off, naturally, would be the furnace (we've already talked about the Crusher and Enrichment Chamber). To replace this we use the Energized Smelter. Works just like a furnace, except it runs off of the power network! You need four redstone dusts, two glass blocks, two Basic Circuits and a Steel Casing to craft this. If you have this hooked up to an Enrichment Chamber, you'll need two to keep up with the supply, as it takes just as long to smelt dusts as it does to enrich ores.\nNext, just to get more wood, we're going to make the precision sawmill. Now, this may not be particularly useful to you, but it could be good to have around just in case. You need a Steel Casing, two Basic Circuits, two Enriched Alloys and four iron ingots, arrayed in the usual pattern. The Precision Sawmill produces six wood planks (instead of the usual four) AS WELL AS a sawdust with each operation. Now, the uses for sawdust within Mekanism itself are fairly limited, but you can use three sawdusts to make a stack of three paper. Can be useful."

                "text": "You Don't Know the Power...\nI wanted to put the next level of power generation in Tier 2 simply because it requires so much setup, even though it doesn't actually require anything with Advanced Control Circuits. But the generation capability of this setup is absolutely astonishing. More on that in a bit. Here's what we'll need:\n\nBasic or Advanced Pressurized Tubes\nBasic or Advanced Logistical Transporters\nBasic or Advanced Mechanical Pipes\nAdvanced Universal Cables or better\nAdvanced Energy Cubes or better\nCrusher\nConfigurator\nChargepad\nElectrolytic Separator\nPressurized Reaction Chamber or PRC\nElectric Pump\nGas-Burning Generator\nYou'll also need an infinite water source, for the pump to draw from.\nThat's quite a list, eh? Well, we've already made Advanced Universal Cables and Energy Cubes, not to mention a Crusher, so that's three off the list that aren't new. The Pressurized Tube, Logistical Transporter and Mechanical Pipe are new, though, and the process for making Advanced versions of them is the same as for the Universal Cable. However, the Basic recipes are different, with the differences being the Tubes need glass, the Pipes need a bucket, and the Transporters need Basic Circuits.\nIn order to use the Transporters properly, though, we'll need the Configurator. This thing, made from 1 Energy Tablet, 1 stick, 1 lapis lazuli and two Enriched Alloys, allows you to configure the various transport items after placement. The thing about the Pipes, Transporters and Tubes is that they have four modes: Push, Pull, Normal (passive) and None (supposed don't allow interaction there? Doesn't quite work like it should in the latest version). You need to configure all the transports that are receiving item/liquid/gas output to Pull that stuff out of the inventory they're attached to. You do this by crouching and right-clicking on the ends of the pipe when they're attached to an inventory. You can also run the same type of transport next to each other and keep them separate by shift-right-clicking the middle section of the transports and assigning color networks to the transports.\nIn order to use the Configurator, though, you need to charge it. And in order to charge it, you need a Chargepad! Go figure! One of these babies can be crafted with three stone pressure plates, two Steel Ingots and an Energy Tablet. Attach it to a Cable and stand on it to activate the charging. Be sure you only have the Configurator in your inventory when you do, because it will charge energy cubes, too.\nNow that you're fully capable of configurating all of the necessary pipes, transports and tubes, we can move on to the actual build. First in the build list is the Electric Pump. Create an infinite water source (2x2 water, if you're not familiar with the concept) then place the pump one block above one of the sources. Hook up the power to the side of it (the only side that has a straight vertical face), and a pipe to the top. I will only remind you once: if a pipe, tube or transport isn't doing what you expect it to, use the configurator to change the mode of the connection to pull.\nNext, we make the Electrolytic Separator. Combine four iron ingots, two redstone dusts, two Enriched Alloys and an Electrolytic Core to make one. Oops, we haven't gotten that one yet! To make a Core, combine five Enriched Alloys, two Osmium Dusts, an iron dust and a gold dust. Make two, while you're at it, you'll need the second one later. When you've made the Separator, place it somewhere and hook up the water supply to it with more pipes. Don't hook it directly up to power yet (or change the redstone sensitivity to high so it doesn't run without active redstone signal), because it's a bit of a power hog. However, you can go and set the oxygen side to Dump its contents. There's a little button under the power bar at the right to let you do so. If you didn't set it to do that (or to dump excess, if you're feeding the oxygen somewhere else), it would fill the oxygen side and not produce any more hydrogen, and we need the hydrogen. Badly.\nAfter that, we get to make the Pressurized Reaction Chamber, or PRC for short. This requires two Basic Circuits, an Enrichment Chamber, an Enriched Alloy, two Gas Tanks and a Dynamic Tank. Wait, wait, wait, TWO new things AT ONCE?! Yikes! Well, let's buckle down for it. The gas tank requires eight Osmium Ingots around an iron dust. Fairly simple. The Dynamic Tank, on the other hand, requires an empty bucket and four Steel Ingots. That recipe actually makes four, so hold on to the others for the later machines. Put the PRC close to the Separator, preferably on the blue tank side of the Separator. The Separator's output cannot be configured, so the hydrogen gas is ejected out of the blue tank side. Run some Tube between them and watch the hydrogen flow. It shouldn't be necessary to change the side config to allow gas input on the side you put it on, but it would be good practice to be in the habit. This is done in the Gases tab of the Side Config (Side Config is the top left tab, and the Gases tab of that is the top right tab).\nNext we'll need to set up the supply for the PRC. The PRC requires Bio Fuel to create the Ethylene that the Gas Generators run on, and this is made by crushing organic matter (wheat, seeds, saplings, etc) in the Crusher. So, set up a crusher and a chest with some transporters between them set to take organics from the chest into the Crusher and then take the Bio Fuel from the Crusher into the PRC. You'll also need to run the water pipes to the PRC and set up the Fluids Config to accept fluids from the side you hook it up to. The Universal Cables can be hooked up on any side and don't require any configuring in the PRC GUI.\nFinally, we get to the Gas-Burning Generator. This is where you use the extra Electrolytic Core you made earlier, combined with two more Steel Casings, two more Enriched Alloys, and four Osmium Ingots. Place this in close proximity to everything else, and hook up the Universal Cables to the side of the Gas Generator that has the yellow coloring (yeah, only one output side), then hook up the Ethylene from the PRC to any of the remaining sides. You may want to throw a couple of Advanced Energy Cubes between the Generator power output and the hookup to the rest of the system.\nApply a power surge to the system from your other setup (the Heat Generator/Solar Generators) to get the Separator started, and then from that point on, as long as you have plenty of Bio Fuel, you have a self-sustaining energy source.\nAstonishingly, once you get this setup running, you can support a whopping 18 Gas Generators with the Ethylene that is produced (gaining 1-2 stored Ethylene per gas output from the PRC), making for a mind-boggling net gain of over 12 kJ/t! When you think about the fact that most basic machines need only 50 J/t at their basic operating level, you're still netting over 10 kJ/t with your entire machine setup running at once!!!. Now you see why I told you to use at least Advanced Cables and Cubes. Elites would be much better (remember, the Advanced Cable is only capable of transferring 8 kJ/t, whereas the Elite Cable is capable of 32 kJ/t).\nI'd like to make a mention at this point of the Bio-Generator. It utilizes Bio Fuel directly instead of using it to create Ethylene, but the power gains you get from using the Gas Generator instead and utilizing Ethylene are more than worth skipping over this one, as long as you have the space for the gas setup. The Bio-Generator creates 700 kJ with two Bio Fuel, however the amount of Ethylene created using those same two Bio Fuel is almost 2 MJ, which is close to three times the amount. It might be good for a stop-gap, but don't spend too long at this stage.\n\nFactories!!!\nNext thing to mention is the Factory upgrades. Factories are basically pimped out versions of the regular machines: Crushers, Enrichers, Smelters, etc. Each one requires the same recipe: the original machine, four redstone dusts, two Basic Circuits and two iron ingots. Got a lot of stuff going? Well, you don't have to break the machine to make the factory, you can just make a Factory Installer of the various levels to upgrade them in place! One thing I want to mention: the factories are literally upgrades of the same machine. They still work the same as their base machine, including requirements for gases/liquids/other catalysts.\n\nThree's A Crowd? Not for ores...\nNow we can get to the real root of Tier 2: the Advanced Control Circuit. It's pretty simple: just a Basic Circuit with Enriched Alloy on both sides. This will allow you to craft the Purification Chamber, which is the base 3x ore machine. The PC outputs ore clumps from ore blocks, and crystals too, but that will be addressed later.\nThe Purification Chamber needs Oxygen Gas in order to process the ores, but this is pretty easy to obtain by running water through the Electrolytic Separator. Oh, would you look at that, we're already doing that in order to make the Ethylene Gas for the Gas Generators, and we're just dumping that oxygen, so an option is to switch over, instead, to the \"Dump Excess\" option, if you're not there already, and pipe that oxygen over to your Purification Chamber. After the ore is processed, dump the clumps in the Crusher to make Dirty Dusts, and then to the Enrichment Chamber to make regular ore dusts. You can choose then whether to keep the dusts or smelt them into ingots.\n\nSidetracking\nThe Advanced Control Circuit also enables you to build a few other things. First, you can build the flamethrower. Nothing like some good old fire spitting. Second, it allows you to build the steam turbine setup. I'm not going to go into that here, as for my purposes, the Gas Generator setup with the Ethylene is enough, even later, but the reactor was just too good to resist.\nIt also allows you to build the Osmium Compressor, which in turn allows you to make Refined Obsidian Ingots and Glowstone Ingots. These then can be used to make tools and armor, and the obsidian versions are significant improvements over their diamond counterparts. For instance, the chestplates compare 2 armor toughness and 8 armor for diamond, whereas the obsidian type gives 4 toughness and 12 armor. The obsidian pickaxe gives 7 more attack damage than the diamond! There are other uses for Refined Obsidian Ingots and dusts, but those come later, in Tier 4. Oh, you can make the dust by infusing obsidian dust with diamond in the Metallurgic Infuser."

                "title": "Tier 3",
                "text": "Covenant Tech\nYes, that's a Halo reference. The next level is Elite, Elite Control Circuits, to be specific, hence the joke. They're as easy to make as the previous level, except this time you need a new alloy, the Reinforced Alloy. You make this in the Metallurgic Infuser as well, putting diamond into the Enriched Alloy, then you put one on either side of an Advanced Circuit to make the Elite Circuit.\n\nOverkill Begins\nIf there could possibly be overkill, this is where it would start. As if 3x ore processing wasn't enough, now we're getting to 4x! It only requires one more machine in the lineup, but in order to feed that machine, we'll need several others.\nFirst, let's build what makes the 4x possible, the Chemical Injection Chamber. This requires a Purification Chamber, four Reinforced Alloys, two Elite Control Circuits, and two gold ingots. Craft it, hook it up to power, place it next to a Purification Chamber, and you're good to go, right?\n\nHydrogen Chloride and the Thermal Evaporation Plant\nNope! The Chemical Injection Chamber needs Hydrogen Chloride Gas in order to work. In order to get this, you'll need several other machines. Firstly, though, you need to build a Thermal Evaporation Plant. This multiblock structure requires three blocks, the Thermal Evaporation Block, which is made by surrounding a copper ingot with 4 steel ingots in a cross-shape; the Thermal Evaporation Valve, which requires an Advanced Control Circuit surrounded by four Thermal Evaporation Blocks in a cross; and the Thermal Evaporation Controller, which requires a bucket, two Advanced Circuits, a glass pane of any kind, and five Thermal Evaporation Blocks.\nThe minimum size possible for this is 4x4 and 3 blocks high, but, of course, the bigger you build it, the faster and better it works. It can never be anything but a 4x4 base, but you can make it up to 18 blocks high. If you make the big one, you'll want to fill the bottom layer with valves that you can pump water through to keep up. You'll also need four Advanced Solar Generators to complete the build, and if you want it to run at peak efficiency, you'll need some Heaters to blast the heat into the Plant (electric is recommended, since we have way more power than we need), and some Thermodynamic Conductors to transfer that heat. The basic ones are made with one copper and two steel, and upgraded in the same was as the Cables or Pipes or Tubes.\nAs a side note, Thermal Evaporation Plants get a small bonus for operating in a desert biome, but it's not enough to run at peak efficiency.\nYou'll also need several Water Pumps and Mechanical Pipes to pump the water into the Plant, and some more Pipes to pull the Brine out. Then, you'll have to pump the Brine into an Electrolytic Separator to get the Chlorine Gas that comes from it, and put that, plus some Hydrogen Gas, into a Chemical Infuser to produce the Hydrogen Chloride you need. Oh, look, yet ANOTHER new machine! Man, Aidan didn't want to make this easy... Anyway, the Chemical Infuser is much lower level, requiring only two Basic Circuits, four Enriched Alloys, a Dynamic Tank block, made with a Bucket and four Steel Ingots, and two Basic Gas Tanks, made with four redstone dusts and four Osmium Ingots.\nFinally, you can start producing the Ore Shards, which you can then feed into the Purification Chamber to continue the process."

                "title": "Tier 4",
                "text": "Epitome of the Basics\nTier 4 is the last level of alloy and circuit, the Atomic Alloy and the Ultimate Control Circuits. The Atomic Alloy is made in the Metallurgic Infuser by putting Refined Obsidian Dust into a Reinforced Alloy. The Ultimate Circuit is made by surrounding an Elite Circuit with two Atomic Alloys.\n\n5 Times the Ore Power!\nNow, we can get into the nitty gritty of Tier 4: 5x ore processing. This requires three new machines: the Chemical Dissolution Chamber, the Chemical Washer, and the Chemical Crystalizer. The Dissolution Chamber, which takes ores and makes them into slurry, requires Sulfuric Acid in order to operate. More on that later. To make the Dissolution Chamber, you need 4 Basic Circuits, two empty Gas Tanks, two Enriched Alloys, and an Atomic Alloy.\nThe Slurry produced by the Dissolution Chamber then goes through Pressurized Tubes to the Chemical Washer, where it's cleaned into Clean Slurry. To make the Chemical Washer, you need only 4 Basic Circuits, 2 Enriched Alloys, one bucket, one empty Gas Tank and a Steel Casing. The Washer requires only water to work.\nThen, you pump that Clean Slurry out, again through Pressurized Tubes, and into the Chemical Crystallizer, which turns the slurry into, you guessed it, Ore Crystals. To make the Crystallizer, you need, again, 4 Basic Circuits, two empty Gas Tanks, a Steel Casing, and two Atomic Alloys. The Crystals can then be fed into the system you already have set up, starting at the Chemical Injector.\nNote two things about this: First, the Dissolution Chamber, Washer, and Crystallizer have no Factory versions of themselves, like the Injector and everything else in the line do, so you may need several of each to make the Injector and on work for a living. The second thing to note is that these three machines each have fixed input and output points, like the Electrolytic Separator. They each have their input on the left, and their output on the right, when just placing them. The Washer's water input is on the top, so keep that in mind when you're running the power lines.\n\nTripping On (Sulfuric) Acid\nNow for some fun stuff. There's at least a 3-step chain to make Sulfuric Acid, which fuels the Dissolution Chamber. You first need to make Sulfur Dioxide from Sulfur in the Chemical Oxidizer. In order to make the Oxidizer, you need 4 Enriched Alloys, two Basic Circuits, a Dynamic Tank, a Personal Chest, and an empty Gas Tank. In order to make the Personal Chest, you will need 5 Steel Ingots, two chests, a Basic Circuit, and a glass block. If you have a lot of cobblestone, or a way of generating it from another mod, there's actually a nice chain you can make, through Mekanism, to generate Sulfur from cobblestone involving four more machines. You start of by feeding the cobble into the Crusher to make gravel, feeding the gravel into a Purification Chamber to make flint, then Crushing the flint again to make gunpowder, then finally, putting it into a Chemical Injection Chamber with Salt or Hydrogen Chloride to make Sulfur.\nAfter making Sulfur Dioxide in the Oxidizer, you need to put the gas into the Chemical Infuser with Oxygen to make Sulfur Trioxide. After that, you need another Chemical Infuser, but this time with Water Vapor, made in a Rotary Condensentrator with water. To make the Rotary Condensentrator, you need four glass blocks, two Basic Circuits, one Energy Tablet, one empty Gas Tank, and one Basic Fluid Tank. In order to make the Fluid Tank, you'll need four iron ingots and four redstone dusts. When you place it down, make sure to hit the T in the top left corner of the GUI to make it run in \"Decondensentrating\" mode, otherwise it won't take the water you feed it. Pump that vapor into the Infuser with the Sulfur Trioxide, and you have your Sulfuric Acid.\nAt this point, it's up to you to expand and optimize your operation. Be warned, if you're splitting up the clean slurry, it can sometimes get stuck in the Crystallizer because it needs 200 mb to make a crystal, and an odd number can sometimes make it transfer 100 to two separate Crystallizers. All you need to do is grab the Dropper and pull the slurry from one and drop it in the other.\n\nFluid Dynamic (Tanks)\nThis is actually a throwback to the first tier's technology, I just never saw a reason to make any until now. Dynamic Tanks are capable of storing massive amounts of fluids. This can come in handy if you need to provide a lot of water without being able to make a bunch of Pump assemblies. A Dynamic Tank is capable of storing 64000 mB (64 buckets) of fluid per block in the structure (including the Valve and Tank [frame] blocks, and the empty spaces between the blocks), which means a minimum-sized Dynamic Tank, which is 3x3x3, is capable of storing 1,728 buckets of fluid! If you take it all the way up to its extreme, the 18x18x18, you can get a whopping 373,248 buckets of storage! Astounding!\nI want to mention, also, that the Basic Gas Tanks can be upgraded to Ultimate versions, as well, and can hold 512000 units of gases per tank, and are fully configurable as far as input and output, so you can still make a group of them all together for one gas, if you want.\n\nWhat If I Told You...\nAlright, now we're finally down to the end game here. The fusion reactor is the be-all end-all of power generation. It's so big, in fact, that I believe the Induction Matrix was made specifically to hold the power generated by the reactor. So, we're going to start with the Matrix.\nOne thing I'd like to bring up now, that didn't seem relevant before, is the Induction Matrix multiblock structure you can make. It's a massive power storage structure (you can make them up to 18x18x18), and the ultimate versions allow for hundreds of giga-joules of energy storage per cell, which really is mind-boggling, especially when you consider the fact that the reactor can only put out several dozen MJ per tick. I can't imagine what you'd need to build to actually need all that power. But, at this point you can build the Advanced versions of the blocks. The Advanced Induction Provider can output 512 kJ per tick, and the Advanced Induction Cell can store 8 GJ per block. If you had merely a 4x4 Matrix, which has a 2-block cube of cells, it would take almost 90 real-life hours to fill with just one Gas Generator. What could you possibly need all that power for? I honestly don't know.\nYou can make the two basic building blocks of the Matrix as things stand now. First, the Induction Casing is made with an Energy Tablet and four Steel Ingots. Then, the Induction Port is made using four of the Casings around an Elite Circuit. But, that's only half of what we need in order to successfully make these things. And in order to make that other half, we need to revisit and old friend, the Thermal Evaporation Plant, to make something altogether new: Lithium Gas and Dusts.\n\nFuuuuuu.... sion.... HA!"

A Crusher crushes clumps into Dirty Dusts. Dirty dusts put into an Enrichment Chamber turn into regular Dusts which can be smelted into ingots. After following this process, you will get four ingots per ore.\nAcquiring Hydrogen Chloride is a long process. You need to build a Thermal Evaporation Plant to turn water into Brine. Put water into one valve using Mechanical Pipe and suck brine out of the plant through another valve, also using pipe, but setting the segment attached to the valve to \"pull\" using a Configurator. You can separate brine into Sodium and Chlorine with an Electrolytic Separator.

                "text": "Mekanism is an independent tech mod that brings many different machinery types to Minecraft, solving problems nobody knew they had. The mod doesn't have any main goals, and you'll notice this when you see the seemingly random content Mekanism contains (from jetpacks to balloons). However, there is a somewhat linear progression system that is both easy to follow and increases in complexity as the player becomes more accustomed to the mod, making sure that the player will have an easy time getting into the mod without ever getting bored of it. By the time anybody has finished a mod pack using Mekanism, if they play a pack without it in the future, the first thought would be \"Man, I wish I had Mekanism!\". This seemingly simple mod has so much to offer to anybody willing to play, with minimal (but necessary grind) and ample rewards for the player's efforts.\nMekanism uses a tier-based system when organizing several of its core features (for instance: Energy Cubes and Factories). There are four tiers: basic (green), advanced (red), elite (cyan), and ultimate (purple), with each tier ordered respectively in increasing order in terms of energy consumption and processing slots (Mekanism does not directly increase processing speed every tier, instead it adds extra processing slots which all process the inputted materials at the same time. Basic is 3 slots, advanced is 5 slots, elite is 7 slots, and ultimate has not been implemented). You can upgrade tiers by placing the component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the next upgrade, or using an tier installer (basically an upgrade kit). Keep in mind that upgrade kits will not upgrade any tier to a higher tier; for instance, an elite tier installer will NOT upgrade a basic factory machine to an elite. The machine can only be upgraded to its next highest tier (Basic -> Advanced -> Elite -> Ultimate).\nBy the time the player has gotten used to using Mekanism, they will have unlimited sand and gravel just from a cobblestone generator, will have a simplistic sorting systems for all of their items, will be obtaining five ingots for each ore they mine, and will be boasting their powerful, heavily equipped, and very protective Mekasuit alongside with their even more powerful Mekatool, which combines the power of Vein miners, Tree Fellers, Axes, Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, and Hoes."

                "text": "Compatibility comes first. While Mekanism will run just fine alone, I (the developer) have spent so very long adding in integration to make Mekanism seem like it blends in perfectly when you have other mods installed. Whether you are powering my machinery with EU, RF, MJ, or whatever it is, they will work. IC2 and TE recipes are implemented in my respective machines, and just about everything else will work as well. I like to think of this as one of Mekanism's best features.\nMekanism features an extremely advanced, extensive ore processing system. From simple machines used to process ores into ingots electronically, to complex chemical-based ore injection used to gain four ingots for every ore mined, Mekanism covers basic smelting, as well as 2x, 3x, and 4x duplication. All machines have configurable input and eject sides, allowing you to have complete control over how you want to manage your machinery. Mekanism also features the Combiner, which allows you to recreate the ores you've already processed.\nMekanism introduces the concept of \"factories,\" which are multi-operation machines that can process multiple stacks of ores simultaneously. In a single machine, you can be smelting several stacks of ore into ingots, enriching several stacks of ores into dusts, or crushing several stacks of cobblestone into gravel. The Factories follow base Mekanism tiers, with the Basic Factories processing three stacks at once, the Advanced Factories processing five stacks at once, and the Elite Factories processing seven stacks at once. In other words, the Factory can be seen as seven machines in one in its elite tier.\nAll Mekanism ores have configurable spawn rates and disable options in the config (Mekanism.config). It's pretty self-explanatory.\nMekanism is founded on the resource Osmium which generates pretty commonly at any Y level below 60. Osmium can be used to create tools and armor, but it is primarily used in the making of machinery. If you have NEI or JEI, you'll see that you really can't do much without Osmium.\nMekanism also generates Tin and Copper, both of which can be easily disabled (and I'm assuming many people will since 99% of mods have their own form of tin and copper).\nMekanism brings five new sets of armor and tools to the table, as well as the ever-famed Paxel (an all-in-one tool).\nHowever, as Mekanism is a \"tech mod,\" it has to have some cool techy gadgets. The Atomic Disassembler is an expensive, electronic multi-tool that can be set to mine at different speeds. The Walkie Talkie is a super fancy device that allows for SMP-based voice chat. Can't forget the Jetpack and Scuba Mask/Tank combination.\nThe Robit is a cute little electronic robot that will follow you around and collect item drops for you. He also serves as a portable furnace, workbench, anvil, chest, and spirit lifter.\nMekanism introduces the \"Digital Miner\" - an automated mining machine that can sort through terrain and pick out the resources you specify. It uses a filter-based system, and will then go through the range you specify and mine the blocks it needs to.\nDynamic Tanks are the best of both worlds: whatever is in between Multi-Tanks and Iron Tanks. These are multiblock tanks that can be shaped as any rectangular prism (capping at 18x18x18). Use Dynamic Glass, Dynamic Valve, and Dynamic Tank blocks to create a tank fit for you!\nMekanism features multiple ways of transmitting items, fluids, gasses, heat and energy from once place to another, using devices we call \"transmitters.\" Transmitters all have some similar characteristics, and these are as follows:\nTransmitters (excluding the Logistical Transporter) will not function when powered by a redstone signal.\nAll transmitters work seamlessly with Forge Multipart.\nExcluding the Logistical Transporter which obviously behaves differently, transmitters hold buffers that are dependent upon how many transmitters are in the network. For example, if you have two Universal Cables connected together, your network will have a capacity of 20 KJ.\nAll transmitters look really cool.\nAll five Mekanism transmitters\nTypes\nUniversal Cable\nCapable of transferring, well, universal energy from one place to another. These guys are super fancy and can be configured on their sides to behave differently.\nPressurized Tubes\nCapable of transferring gasses from one place to another.\nMechanical Pipes\nCapable of transferring fluids from one place to another. These guys are a feat of rendering, they look way cool.\nThermodynamic Conductor\nCapable of transferring heat from one place to another.\nLogistical Transporters\nCapable of transferring items and blocks from one place to another. These function identically to RedPower tubes, and have a fully-implemented color-coded sorting system.\nQIO is a way of storing large amounts of items that can be stored, searched, and accessed remotely in late game."

Each vent can pass 32,000 mB/t; each disperser can disperse 1,280 mB/t *per block of interior volume*.\n\"Interior volume\" -- labeled `structure.lowerVolume` below -- means the inside volume of the rotor chamber. So if your base is 11x11 and you have 4 blocks of rotor shaft, then your interior volume is 9x9x4=324 blocks, and every disperser disperses 414,720 mB/t.\nThe flow rate is the product of two numbers:\nThe fill ratio of the turbine: (volume of steam)/(maximum volume of steam)\nThe current rate of steam flow, as a fraction of MAX_RATE.

Should a balloon be attached to the player the player can simply pop it by looking up and hitting the balloon. If the Balloon is allowed to float up it will pop at world height (y:256).

Since the Heat Generator outputs so little power and it is fairly inexpensive to create, it is common to have two or three generators constantly trickling power into one or more Energy Cubes. Regardless of its price, the player should look to upgrade as soon as possible, as its energy yield is far from enough to power even a few simple machines.\nActive Power\nThe active mode of generation comes from loading combustible materials into the generator. They will be burned, and the heat will be converted to power at the rate of 4 kJ/s (200 J/t). All active power fuels generate power at the same rate, but higher tier fuels will burn for a longer time, producing more total power. If a lava bucket is fed into the Heat Generator, it will consume the lava, but return the bucket.\nPassive Power\nPassive power can be generated by placing the Heat Generator adjacent to a lava source or flowing lava.

If you do not wish to leave empty spaces where ore blocks used to be, fill the block replacement slot with any block, turn on the requirement in the filters, and supply the necessary blocks in the machine's inventory.\nOnce powered and your filters made, hit the Start button back in the main interface to start mining.\nThe Digital Miner has two IO-Slots (indicated by a yellowish-tan square), the one on the back, where the items can be picked up, i.e. by Logistical Transporter (mod equivalent of an item pipe) and the one on the top front to insert replacement blocks, i.e. from a bin (mod equivalent of a container).\nTo speed up the miner, use speed upgrades.  To increase the energy capacity and efficiency of the miner, install energy upgrades. Up to 8 can be used for a 10x effect for both upgrades.\nIt is not recommended to use the digital miner to break items of high importance (machinery/altars) without first testing what effects it can cause (worst case being the item breaks without it dropping and not appearing in the Digital Miner's inventory). If you are unsure of anything, try testing the desired item/block first (ores should always be safe to mine). \nEven though it can bypass obstacles (e.g. warded zones from Thaumcraft, shielded areas from RFTools etc.) by directly accessing the block, it cannot break unharvestable blocks or redstone."

It will NOT scan the area for any blocks/items placed after the start button was pressed. The miner will need to be reset for it to re-scan the area for new blocks.\n\n2\nStop Button\nStops mining.\n\n3\nConfig Button\nBrings up the config interface (see GUI below). This button will be unavailable to click once the start button has been pressed, the reset button must be pressed to allow access to the config interface.\n\n4\nEnergy Slot\nInsert a source of energy (like a charged Energy Tablet or Energy Cube) to power the digital miner. This does not need to be used if power is provided externally through one of its energy ports.\n\n5\nBlock Status\nIndicates if blocks are needed to replace mined ones. If the indication is on, you will need to supply the shown block or else the miner will not continue to mine.\n\n6\nReset Button\nResets the digital miner; allows for the config to be accessed again and re-scans the area for new blocks after hitting the start button.\n\n7\nAuto-Eject Button\nToggles auto-eject mode; automatically ejects blocks/items not used for replacing mined ones. If there is nothing connected to the output port, the miner will not eject anything.\n\n8\nSilk Touch Button\nToggles Silk Touch mode, where mined blocks act as if mined by a pickaxe enchanted with silk touch. This mode comes at the expense of utilizing six times as much energy.\n\n9\nAuto-Pull Button\nToggles auto-pull mode; automatically pulls blocks from a container (like a bin) for replacing mined blocks. Do not insert items in the top port (like a pipe or an export bus), just place the container (with the corresponding blocks) directly on top of the port.\n\n10\nUpgrade Tab\nOpens up the upgrade interface. The digital miner is able to accept speed and energy upgrades, eight each for a maximum multiplier effect of 10.\n\n11\nSecurity Tab\nChanges who is allowed to use/access the digital miner. Set it to private to restrict other players, public for free access, or trusted for friends.\n\n12\nRedstone Control\nChanges the behavior of the digital miner with redstone. Default setting is disabled, allowing for manual control. The digital miner can accept the signal on any of its sides.\n\n13\nEnergy Information\nIndicates how much energy will be utilized during operation, how much is needed if lacking an insufficient supply of energy and the current unit of energy. Click this tab to change the energy unit used (RF/EU/MJ/J).\n\n14\nVisual Toggle\nClick this to see the area that the digital miner will cover when mining. The visuals/field will appear as white cubes so as long as the area is not occupied by any blocks. The white cubes represent the maximum area the digital miner will cover, including blocks at those cubes.\n\n15\nDisplay Screen\nDisplays the current status of the digital miner. 'Idle' when not running, 'Running' when operating, 'Not Ready' when machine has not run after being reset, 'Ready' after running at least once, what modes are currently active (On/Off) and how many blocks are left to be mined.\n\n16\nEnergy Buffer\nHover the cursor over the bar to see how much energy is currently stored by the digital miner. As it depletes, the green bar will decrease.\n\n17\nDigital Miner Inventory\nMined blocks/items will be stored here. Replacement blocks for the mined blocks can also be placed here instead of using a container with blocks and auto-pull mode active. Once this inventory is full, the digital miner will continue to run but not mine any blocks, so please ensure that this inventory is kept cleared by collecting the items or by using the auto-eject function."

Alternatively you can just use your mousewheel.\n\n3\nFilter List\nEdit/Delete your filters by clicking them. You can adjust the priority of what is mined first or last by clicking the triangular arrows near the bottom right corner of each filter (top is highest, bottom is lowest). Sadly you CANNOT turn a filter on/off.\n\n4\nCreate New Filter Button\nClick this to add a new filter for the digital miner to use. You can choose between 'ItemStack', 'OreDict', 'Material', and 'Mod ID'. Once you've chosen one, you'll have to configure it (see Filters below for more info).\n\n5\nInverse Button\nToggles inverse mode, in which it will mine everything but the blocks/items listed in the filter list. A practical use for this is to add filters for common blocks like stone, gravel, dirt, grass, sand, etc., using inverse mode this way will make it mine everything, even blocks that might not be included in the ore dictionary.\n\n6\nConfig Screen\nDisplays the current amount of filters made/used (after the T colon), the radius (in blocks), the minimum y-value, the maximum y-value, the last three contributing to what area the digital miner will cover, and lastly whether inverse mode is on or off (after the I colon).\n\n7\nRadius Setting\nType in the radius you want the digital miner to cover in the black text box left to the check box. Acceptable values are 0-32, where 0 is one block directly at the center of the digital miner, 1-32 will add the corresponding sized square around this block (# of blocks from the center to the edge/corner). Area: (2x+1)2, x = radius.\n\n8\nMinimum Y-value Setting\nType in the minimum y-value the digital miner will cover. This value cannot be higher than the maximum y-value, if set to a higher value, it will be set to the current maximum y-value. Setting the max/min y-values to the same number allows the miner to mine one layer of blocks.\n\n9\nMaximum Y-value Setting\nType in the maximum y-value the digital miner will cover. This value cannot be lower than the minimum y-value, if set to a lower value, the value will not change from its current one."

The Digital Miner will mine everything but these common materials.\n\nSilk Touch Mode\nThe Silk Touch button toggles the Silk Touch mode. When mining coal, the miner will instead receive Coal Ore blocks, rather than pieces of Coal. However, this mode requires 6x the amount of energy it needs.\n\nAuto-Eject\nThe Auto-Eject button toggles the eject function. When a block is mined, the block will automatically be sent to a connected pipe, leading to a chest or to an ore processing machine. If the other end of the pipe is not attached to anything, the miner won't eject them.\n\nAuto-Pull\nThe Auto-Pull button toggles the pull function. When a block is mined, the miner will automatically collect one block from a container to replace the mined block. If the required replacement block is missing from the container, depending on the state of the block replacement requirement setting is (active for any filter or inactive for all filters), the miner will stop (active) or continue mining (inactive). \n\nBlock Replacement\nNot really a mode, but a feature of the filters. When a block is mined, you can choose to leave another block in its it by specifying a block in the filter. Using Auto-Pull mode with this feature is highly recommended so as to keep the digital miner inventory clear and not having to frequently worry about keeping a constant flow/supply of replacement blocks."

Some items (e.g. string) cannot be added to the filter despite being able to be placed in the world. If nothing is being detected (it says 0 below the \"To mine:\" in the display screen of the main interface) when you start to mine, try turning fuzzy mode on (this will likely be the case for items that can have different orientations, e.g. levers and buttons). \n\n\nNumber\nLabel\nDescription\n\n1\nBack Arrow\nBrings you back to the Create New Filter screen.\n\n2\nItem Slot\nPut the item/block you desire to mine/break here. It'll just remember what item you put there, the item/block you used is still available to you.\n\n3\nFuzzy Mode\nToggles fuzzy mode, in which the filter will also include all metadata values for the id of the item/block. Hover over this to see if fuzzy mode is off or on.\n\n4\nSave Button\nSaves your game...no, it'll just add the filter to the miner or save any changes you made to the filter.\n\n5\nDelete Button\nDeletes the filter.

Found a non-destructive troll? Rewire it nearby and make the unsuspecting sap responsible trip it off while he/she's checking what happened (just make sure not to reset the miner and turn it on, you'll undo \"your\" handiwork).\nSet it to Essence Oreberry bush (Tinkers' Construct) and turn fuzzy mode on to find bushes without having to manually search for them for an experience farm.\nGot a bunch of multi-colored wool/clay that you want to remove but can't vein-mine? Set it to wool/clay and turn fuzzy mode on and go do something else while you wait.\nChange parts of your house from one block (put it in the Item Slot) to another (put it in the Replacement Slot) to swap them with minimal effort.\nWarded blocks around your chest or ME drive (AE2)? Set it a chest or ME drive and turn fuzzy mode on and grab your stuff through the blocks. Only do this if you're sure you can get them or you'll risk despawning them. A single block on each side should be fine (test first).\nOreDict/Ore Dictionary\nDescription: This filter allows you to mine ores or blocks by using their ore dictionary names. Depending on what mods you've got, you may be able to see the name by holding shift while hovering over the ore/block you want to mine (can be done in NEI), if not you'll have to use a Dictionary. After entering the name and hitting the checkbox, you'll see the icon of the ore/block in the slot in the ore slot if it worked, otherwise, you'll see a blank slot. This means the name doesn't exist or you didn't spell and/or capitalize the name correctly. It should also be noted that * can be used, when added at the end, it mines everything starting with the given name, e.g. oreC* will mine coal ore (oreCoal), copper ore (oreCopper) and certus quartz ore (oreCertusQuartz and oreChargedCertusQuartz).\n\n\nNumber\nLabel\nDescription\n\n1\nBack Arrow\nBrings you back to the Create New Filter screen.\n\n2\nOre Slot\nThe ores/blocks with the matching ore dictionary name entered will appear here, shifting from one to the next. If there is nothing displayed then the name is invalid (unless the ore is invisible).\n\n3\nOre Dictionary Input Box\nType the ore dictionary name here and click the little checkbox to the right or hit the enter key to input the name.\n\n4\nSave Button\nSaves your game...no, it'll just add the filter to the miner or save any changes you made to the filter.\n\n5\nDelete Button\nDeletes the filter. What more could you want? (The ability to turn on/off a filter maybe?)\n\n6\nRequire Replacement Setting\nTurn this on to force the miner to only mine so as long as the block/item in the replacement slot is in the digital miner's inventory or in a container on the import port with auto-pull mode activated.

The detection is not perfected yet as it may miss some blocks even though it can be crafted by the material specified, other times it will mine similar material even though it's not made out of the material specified, e.g. specify oak wood planks, it will mine spruce stairs. Similar to the ItemStack/Item filter, not all items and blocks will be accepted, even diamonds cannot be specified despite being used in a wide variety of blocks/machines.\n\n\nNumber\nLabel\nDescription\n\n1\nBack Arrow\nBrings you back to the Create New Filter screen.\n\n2\nMaterial Slot\nPut the material (block/item) you wish to mine/break here.

It'll inform you what blocks are missing in the block status on the main interface while mining.\n\n7\nReplacement Slot\nPut the block item or block you want to be put in place of the item/block you're mining.\n\nUnlikely Use:\nIn case you were put in an evil modpack with common materials (wood and cobblestone) only being harvestable by uncrafting them and this same modpack somehow has Mekanism, set the desired material and harvest away while you think about what Minecraftian life choices you made led you here. (In other words, the previous two filters should meet your needs.)\nMod ID\nDescription: This filter allows you to mine blocks/items by mod ID. Although you can find out what the mod ID in game is by pressing F3 + h simultaneously, it doesn't seem as if Mekanism uses these IDs (save for Mekanism core). There seems to be an established list of mods that Mekanism uses, most well-known mods (e.g. Ender IO) should be available to enter. Not all blocks/items will be mined even though the item couldn't be added to ItemStack/Item filter but is in the mod (e.g. entering the ID: Minecraft will still not allow the miner to detect/mine redstone repeaters and comparators). Like with the OreDict filter, * can also be used at the end to set the filter to use any mod IDs beginning what was before the asterisk (e.g. inputting Thermal* will use the IDs: Thermal Foundation and Thermal Expansion. After entering the ID and hitting the checkbox, you'll see various blocks from the specified mod in the mod slot if it worked, otherwise, you'll see a blank slot.\n\n\nNumber\nLabel\nDescription\n\n1\nBack Arrow\nBrings you back to the Create New Filter screen.\n\n2\nMod Slot\nVarious blocks from the specified mod will appear here, shifting from one to the next.

It may look intimidating at first, but for most installations you will only use a couple controls.\nCommon Controls\nAuto Eject (4). This will tell your machine to automatically eject its output item, if there is a suitable inventory to receive it. If there is nothing to receive an item, the machine will hold onto its products. Mekanism machines will not spill your items all over the floor!  :) Clicking the A button will toggle the Auto-Eject function on/off.\nSlot/Side Assignment (6). This is where you assign a specific colored slot to the sides of your machine. The image of six squares corresponds to each of the six sides. The gray box in the middle is the front, above that (red) is the top. To the left is the left side (orange), to the right is the right side (dark blue). Below the gray square is the bottom side (green), and in the lower left is the back side (also gray). Note that all sides are configured as if you were facing the machine, not from the machines point of view. You can change which slot connects to which side by clicking on the appropriate side. As you click, you will cycle through all available colors. Not all colors will be a valid slot color. So if you wanted to configure your machine like in the example with the top as the input (red) and the right and back sides as outputs (blue), the top and right are already set up, you only need to click the gray box in the lower left a few times until the dark blue color is selected. Done! It really is that easy. Gray is the \"no connection\" color.\nAdvanced Controls\nLooking to really customize your system? Read on!\nOutput Color Frame(3). This will set a colored \"frame\" around items as they exit the machine. In the example above, all ejected items will have a green frame. Mekanism Logistics Pipes will use this frame color to route the items to a matching-colored destination. If no destination has a matching color, the first available destination inventory will receive the item.\nInput Filter on/off(5). This turns on/off the input filter feature for the machine. If turned on, then machine will only accept items whose color frames match the input filters. If the colors don't match the filter... they will not be accepted. You can set the input color filters by using...\nInput Color Filters(2). Like the output configuration (6), each of these squares corresponds with a side of the machine. If a color is set for one of these squares, that side will only accept items if they have a matching color frame. So if you want to be sure that coal goes to the Enrichment Chamber and not the Crusher, set a color filter on the output of the machine that ejects the coal, then set a matching color input filter of your Enrichment Chamber.

Connecting a Pressurized Tube or other compatible pipe to both tanks will remove the gas. If you are only using a single gas, selecting \"dump\" for the unused gas will vent it to the environment, preventing that internal tank from filling completely and stopping the Separator.\nSince Mekanism 7.1 (Minecraft 1.7.10) the Electrolytic Separator requires 400 joules of power per tick, or 160 FE per tick. Without upgrades, it performs 1 operation per tick. Notably, each speed upgrade doubles the operation speed of this machine, for 256 operations per tick with the maximum of 8 speed upgrades.\nPlease note that while the Electrolytic Separator does take Energy Upgrades, they don't actually affect the machine's energy efficiency, for balancing purposes."
